# Mahdiisdumb-School-Archive

This repo holds all my school homework, classwork, and assessments from grades 7–12.  
I’m storing this mostly for my own reference and to show off my bad handwriting (yes, it’s terrible). :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## What’s in here

This isn’t a software project — it’s an archive of folders with scanned work and files from various subjects including math, science, and more.  
The structure is basically whatever I dumped in — **no organized build system, no apps, nothing fancy**.

## How to browse this

Just click through the folders. Each subject/year has its own directory.  
There’s no installation, compilation, or setup needed. It’s just file storage.

## Usage

Since this isn’t code you run, here’s how someone might use it:

1. Open the subject folder you want to see.
2. Find the work you’re looking for (e.g., “Math/Homework”).
3. Click files to view them in your browser or download them.  
If you want offline access, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mahdiisdumb/Mahdiisdumb-School-Archive.git
